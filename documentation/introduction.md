# Introduction

This document describes how to work with the fungible token standard on Mina. The corresponding code
can be found on [github](https://github.com/MinaFoundation/mina-fungible-token), or installed as an
[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mina-fungible-token).

The fungible token standard uses Mina's native support for custom tokens (see
[MIP-4](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/MIPs/blob/main/MIPS/mip-zkapps.md#token-mechanics)). An
account on Mina can be created to hold either Mina, or a custom token.

To create a new token, one creates a smart contract, which becomes the owner for the token, and uses
that contract to set the rules around how the token can be minted, burned and transferred. The
contract may also set a token symbol. Uniqueness is not enforced for token names. Instead the public
key of the contract is used to derive the token's unique identifier.

The token contract defines the behavior of the token -- how tokens can be minted, burned,
transferred, etc. The fungible token standard consists of a smart contract that is suitable for
fungible tokens.

## SHOW ME THE CODE

The
[`mina-fungible-token` repo's e2e example](https://github.com/MinaFoundation/mina-fungible-token/blob/main/examples/e2e.eg.ts)
showcases the entire lifecycle of a token.

After running `npm i mina-fungible-token`, import the `FungibleToken` and `FungibleTokenAdmin`
contracts and deploy them:

```ts
const token = new FungibleToken(contract.publicKey)
const adminContract = new FungibleTokenAdmin(admin.publicKey)

const deployTx = await Mina.transaction({
  sender: deployer,
  fee,
}, async () => {
  AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(deployer, 3)
  await adminContract.deploy({ adminPublicKey: admin.publicKey })
  await token.deploy({
    symbol: "abc",
    src: "https://github.com/MinaFoundation/mina-fungible-token/blob/main/examples/e2e.eg.ts",
  })
  await token.initialize(
    admin.publicKey,
    UInt8.from(9),
    Bool(false),
  )
})
await deployTx.prove()
deployTx.sign([deployer.key, contract.privateKey, admin.privateKey])
await deployTx.send()
```

> Note: this example assumes that `contract` and `deployer` are valid key pairs in scope.

## How?

How is this custom token mechanism implemented in Mina?

### Token Owner Account

The token owner account is a contract with the following capabilities.

- Set a token symbol (also called token name) for its token. Uniqueness is not enforced for token
  names because the public key of the owner account is used to derive a unique identifier for each
  token.
- Mint new tokens. The zkApp updates an account's balance by adding the newly created tokens to it.
  You can send minted tokens to any existing account in the network.
- Burn tokens (the opposite of minting). Burning tokens deducts the balance of a certain address by
  the specified amount. A zkApp cannot burn more tokens than the specified account has.
- Send tokens between two accounts. There are two ways to initiate a transfer: either, the token
  owner can create the account updates directly (via the `transfer` method), or the account updates
  can be created externally, and then approved by the token owner (see
  [Approval mechanism](#approval-mechanism)).

### Token Account

Token accounts are like regular accounts, but they hold a balance of a specific custom token instead
of MINA. A token account is specified by a public key _and_ a token id.

Token accounts are specific for each type of custom token, so a single public key can have many
different token accounts.

A token account is automatically created for a public key whenever an existing account receives a
transaction denoted with a custom token.

> [!IMPORTANT] When a token account is created for the first time, an account creation fee must be
> paid the same as creating a new standard account.

### Token ID

Token ids are unique identifiers that distinguish between different types of custom tokens. Custom
token identifiers are globally unique across the entire network.

Token ids are derived from a Token Owner account. Use the `deriveTokenId()` function to get the id
of a token.

### Approval mechanism

Sending tokens between two accounts must be approved by a Token Owner zkApp. This can be done with
the `approveBase()` method of the custom token standard reference implementation.

> [!IMPORTANT] When manually constructing `AccountUpdate`s, make sure to order then appropriately in
> the call to `approveBase()`. The contract will not allow flash minting, i.e., tokens cannot be
> received by an account before they have been sent from an account.

[!NOTE] The number of `AccountUpdate`s that you can pass to `approveBase()` is limited by the base
token contract. The current limit is 9.
