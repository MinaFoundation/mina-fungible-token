# mina-token

In this repository, we develop a reference implementation for a standard for defining fungible tokens on Mina.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test packages/token/test/token.test.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.7. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
